# FreeLibrary
## A typical library manager software

This is a personal project to study [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)/[React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)/[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[Unit Tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/walkthrough-creating-and-running-unit-tests-for-managed-code?view=vs-2019)
So if you see anything strange don't worry, I'm learning and your help will be welcome

I hope to start this with a "Helo-World" and maybe turn it into a functional project.
